		  			<h4>I like designing things and wearing them to look cool. COOL? Cool.</h4>
		  			<p>My name is Isabel, graphic designer and web developer living in good ol' Music City, USA. When Iâ€™m hanging out with my adorable yorkie Teddy or attending all the concerts I possibly can (for research, of course), I am busy creating visual media that is interesting in the most succinct way possible. I am constantly looking to expand my brain with knowledge of both the analog and digital creative processes from pen and ink techniques to coding more proficiently with AngularJS.</p>
